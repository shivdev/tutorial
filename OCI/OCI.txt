OCI PROCESS as applicable to me

DISCLAIMER:
==========
1. I'm NOT an attorney. I'm certainly NOT your legal advisor. I'm a Silicon Valley Techie.
2. Do your own research and check CKGS (Cox & Kings) and Govt. of India Websites to get the latest updates. Process will change and this video will be obsolete/defunct.
3. Consult your legal advisors (or attorney) for questions.


PURPOSE:
=======
1. Explain my OCI process.
2. Clear the FUD (Fear, Uncertainity & Doubt) on the OCI Process.
3. Go over relevant websites (in Dec 2016) to perhaps help you in your process.

1. A naturalized US Citizen looking to get an OCI, who previously was a Citizen of India.
2. In the process of naturalization and intend to start after naturalization.
